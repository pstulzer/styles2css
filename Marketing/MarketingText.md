# xliff-translate

## Description
You know the situation, you have spent hours placing all text in Figma, arranged everything nicely, checked it several times with the people in charge, made the last corrections and everyone is happy and satisfied? Task accomplished! Then someone is asking for all the text you have in your Figma because it needs to be translated. Easy right?

If your translation service provider works with xliff, you now have a solution.  With xliff-translate you can export all text layers to a file which then can be translated and if needed, imported again into Figma.


###Features

You can choose to export from a singe selection to the whole document. Be aware, that the more layers you want to export, the longer it will take to process your request.

If you have selected the whole document for export, you can also decide whether the layers should be grouped by pages or all together in the XLIFF document.  An example. You have used the phrase "Hello World" on several pages. With the option "Merge Layers" selected, this phrase has to be translated only once. Without this option, the phrase will appear separately for each page.

By default locked and hidden layers are not exported. If you need to, you can include them in the export.

Importing an XLIFF document is easy. Load it either by clicking on the “Import XLIFF” button and selecting the file on your computer or by dropping the file onto the import button.

**WARNING!!**  
**If you have more than one text style in one text layer only the first style will be used for the imported text!**
